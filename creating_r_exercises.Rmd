# Introduction{-}
This tutorial will show you how you can host interactive rmarkdowns for free on myBinder.org. 

## What is myBinder?{-}
Binder is a project that aims to provide a service where people can publish and host their interactive repositories publicly. Binder is capable with many languages include Python, Java, R and Julia. This open-source project provides users the opportunity to access environments without having to manually setup themselves. This is particularly useful for an audience with little code knowledge, or for people who do not necessarily want to spend time setting up dependencies on their own computers, in order to see the markdown. 

A typical binder code repository relies on the content that should be run for the audience to interact with and configuration files which determine the environment binder should run, i.e setting up a RStudio environment or a Python environment etc. In the setup section, we will discuss possible options in which you can create configuration files for Binder. 

### Positives of Binder{-}
* Free open-source hosting service for interactive r documents
* Usable in several languages
* Perfect for reproducible research  

### Limitations of Binder{-}
* Has limited memory space, therefore it is not ideal large data projects
* Each instance only lasts for 12 hours and will die after 10 minutes of inactivity
* Does not store changes made in RStudio i.e saving documents is not possible through Binder.

# Setup Process{-}
To see a working binder example of this tutorial click this badge: 
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kimchi8/r-binder-example/HEAD?urlpath=%2Frstudio)

The github repository of this example can be accessed [here](https://github.com/kimchi8/r-binder-example).

### Step 1 -Create a Dockerfile{-}
Create a Dockerfile on github and use the following code
![Create a dockerfile image](/path/to/image.png)


```{r dockerfile_template, eval=FALSE, class.source='klippy'} 
FROM rocker/binder:3.6.3

## Declares build arguments

ARG NB_USER

ARG NB_UID

## Copies your repo files into the Docker Container

USER root

COPY . ${HOME}

## Enable this to copy files from the binder subdirectory

## to the home, overriding any existing files.

## Useful to create a setup on binder that is different from a

## clone of your repository

RUN chown -R ${NB_USER} ${HOME}

## Become normal user again

USER ${NB_USER}

## Ensures that the rstudio version will run on Binder
RUN python3 -m venv ${VENV_DIR} && \
    # Explicitly install a new enough version of pip
    pip3 install pip==9.0.1 && \
    pip3 install --no-cache-dir \
         nbrsessionproxy==0.6.1 && \
    jupyter serverextension enable --sys-prefix --py nbrsessionproxy && \
    jupyter nbextension install    --sys-prefix --py nbrsessionproxy && \
    jupyter nbextension enable     --sys-prefix --py nbrsessionproxy

## Run an install.R script, if it exists.
RUN if [ -f install.R ]; then R --quiet -f install.R; fi

```
